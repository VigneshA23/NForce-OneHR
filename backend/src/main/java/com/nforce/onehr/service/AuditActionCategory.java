/**
 * Splits the free-text {@code audit_log.action} values into the two slices the read API
 * exposes per role: HR Admin only ever sees {@link #HR_OPERATIONAL}; Super Admin sees both.
 * The split is by originating service (confirmed with product): everything logged by
 * AuthService/UserManagementService is access-control, everything else is HR-operational.
 *
 * <p>This is also the single source of truth for which actions are trackable in this feature
 * at all — the audit pages were narrowed from a system-wide trail to a personal activity
 * history, so pure authentication/session events (AuthService's login and password
 * self-service flows), self-service attendance punches (attendance check-in/out, web
 * clock-in requests and checkout), and self-submitted requests (leave/expense/asset
 * submissions, regularization requests/edits) are deliberately omitted from both sets
 * below — they never appear anywhere in the feature (table, cards, stats, or export),
 * since {@link AuditActionGroup#knownActions()} and every query in {@code AuditQueryService}
 * derive from {@link #allActions()}.
