/**
 * Web Clock-In / Check-in: any employee working remotely can self-declare a check-in — it
 * upserts the day's {@link Attendance} row (source WEB_REMOTE) and starts counting worked time
 * immediately, the same instant it's submitted. There is no approval step at all — no
 * PENDING/APPROVED/REJECTED review, no approve/reject decision, no Approval Center entry. In its
 * place, the FIRST Web Clock-In of an employee's resolved work day requires a note/reason and
 * sends the employee's Reporting Manager a purely informational notification (no action, no
 * link into an approval queue) — every later Web Clock-In cycle within the SAME resolved work day
 * needs no note and never re-notifies the manager (see {@code submit}'s own comment for how
 * "first cycle of the day" is determined). Check-out and cancel need no note/approval either,
 * and Check-out never notifies anyone.
 *
 * <p>An employee can Web Clock-In and Web Clock-Out any number of times within the same resolved
 * work day — each cycle is its own row, and every one of them (open or closed) contributes to the
 * day's punch history and combined worked-minutes total (see {@code collectPunches}/
 * {@code recomputeCombinedWorkedMinutes} in {@link AttendanceService}). Only ONE Web session may
 * be open (not yet checked out) at a time — see {@code submit}'s own open-session guard — that is
 * a concurrency guard, not a once-per-day restriction.
 *
 * <p>Web Clock-In/Out is deliberately independent of normal Check-In/Check-Out: each is tracked
 * via its own open/closed state (this class's own WebClockInRequest.checkedOutAt vs.
 * AttendanceService's AttendancePunch.checkOutAt) and neither blocks on, or is blocked by, the
 * other — an employee can be normally checked in AND have an open Web Clock-In session at the
 * same time. Submitting or checking out a Web Clock-In session must never flip the normal
 * Check-In/Check-Out status (canCheckIn/canCheckOut) shown on the dashboard — see
 * AttendanceService.getToday, which derives that purely from AttendancePunch. The two sources'
 * worked time is still combined into one total without double-counting any overlap — see
 * AttendanceService.recomputeCombinedWorkedMinutes, called from both this class's checkOut and
 * AttendanceService's own.
