/**
 * Single source of truth for "what shift-relative day/time does this instant belong to" —
 * extracted from what were previously independently-duplicated private methods on
 * {@link AttendanceService} (and copies in {@link WebClockInService},
 * {@link RegularizationService}, {@link ExceptionService}). Pure and side-effect-free: every
 * method here only computes and returns a value — none of them read or write an
 * {@link com.nforce.onehr.entity.Attendance} row, flag anything, or close a session, or query
 * one — that remains entirely the job of {@link AttendanceService}/{@link StaleAttendanceSweeper}
 * exactly as before; this class only ever answers "what day/time," never "what should happen."
 *
 * <h2>The five concepts, kept deliberately distinct</h2>
 * <ol>
 * <li><b>Scheduled shift end</b> — {@link #shiftEndAt}. What the shift is actually scheduled to
 * end at, per the version effective on the day in question. Unrelated to the boundary below.
 * <li><b>Logical workday reset</b> — {@link #maximumAttendanceBoundary} / {@link #shiftDayOf}.
 * The ONLY thing the organization's {@code maximumShiftDayDurationHours} setting controls: which
 * calendar day a punch is attributed to. It does not close, flag, or create anything.
 * <li><b>Overtime</b> — not modeled here (no dedicated overtime computation exists anywhere in
 * this codebase); working past the scheduled end simply stays part of the same logical workday
 * until the reset.
 * <li><b>Stale/missing-checkout handling</b> — owned entirely by
 * {@link AttendanceService#flagMissingCheckoutIfStale}/{@link WebClockInService}'s own analogous
 * check and {@link StaleAttendanceSweeper}. Those callers now source their "has this record's own
 * day moved on" input from {@link #shiftDayOf} instead of a fixed global cutover — the decision to
 * act on that input (flag/reject) is unchanged and stays entirely with them.
 * <li><b>Auto-checkout</b> — does not exist anywhere in this codebase and is not introduced here.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h2>Shift Versions — every timing lookup is keyed by a date, never "now"</h2>
 * A {@link Shift}'s timing is effective-dated ({@link ShiftVersion}, resolved via
 * {@link ShiftVersionResolver}) rather than a single mutable value on the Shift itself — every
 * method on this class that needs an actual start/end time resolves the version effective on the
 * SPECIFIC day it was asked about (typically an {@code Attendance.workDate}, fixed once at
 * check-in and never recomputed), never "whichever version happens to be current when this code
 * executes." This is what lets an admin change a Shift's future timing without silently
 * reinterpreting an in-progress or already-recorded Attendance for a date the new version doesn't
 * yet (or no longer) govern — see {@link ShiftVersion}'s own Javadoc for the full design.
 *
 * <h2>Logical-day algorithm</h2>
 * For an employee (every employee has an assigned {@link Shift} — see this class's own "No-shift
 * employees" section below), the day for a given {@code timestamp} is computed relative to that
 * shift's own start (for the day in question), not a fixed clock time. Two rules apply, in order:
 * <ol>
 * <li><b>Today's own start, first.</b> If {@code timestamp} has already reached the version
 * effective on {@code timestamp}'s own calendar date's start time, it unambiguously belongs to
 * that calendar date — regardless of what YESTERDAY's boundary would otherwise suggest. Without
 * this check, a Shift Version whose new start time is meaningfully earlier than the previous
 * version's own 18-hour reset would incorrectly swallow a legitimate fresh, on-time arrival under
 * the new version into the previous logical workday — see the worked example below.
 * <li><b>Otherwise, yesterday's boundary.</b> A timestamp still belongs to YESTERDAY's logical
 * workday if it falls before yesterday's own {@link #maximumAttendanceBoundary}; otherwise it
 * belongs to today's (even though today's own shift hasn't nominally started yet — an early punch
 * is an ordinary early-arrival concern, not a shift-day one).
 * </ol>
 * Verified against every worked example in the design discussion, including:
 * <ul>
 * <li>09:00-18:00, 18h max: boundary = 03:00 the next day. A 01:00 punch (technically "tomorrow")
 * still belongs to TODAY's logical workday (overtime continuation); a 05:00 punch (after the
 * boundary, before tomorrow's own 09:00 start) already belongs to TOMORROW's.
 * <li>15:30-00:30 (overnight), 18h max: boundary = 09:30 the next day. Punches at 00:20, 00:30,
 * 01:00, 05:00, and 07:00 all still belong to the PREVIOUS logical workday; 09:30 and 10:00
 * already belong to the new one.
 * <li><b>Version-boundary case</b>: Shift changes from 15:30-00:30 to a NEW version effective
 * today, 06:00-15:00. A fresh check-in today at 06:00 (no open session) correctly resolves to
 * TODAY — not yesterday, even though yesterday's own (old-version) 18h boundary would otherwise
 * extend to 09:30 today — because today's own (new-version) start (06:00) has already been
 * reached. Reversed (06:00-15:00 -> 15:30-00:30, fresh check-in today at 15:30) is unaffected
 * either way, since the OLD version's short same-day boundary never reached that far regardless.
 * <li><b>Brand-new Shift case</b>: a Shift created (and assigned) TODAY has, by design, no version
 * effective before today (see {@code OrgService#createShift} and the V159 migration backfill's own
 * comment) — there is no "yesterday" for it to have an overnight tail under. A fresh check-in
 * today before today's own start therefore never falls back to Rule 2's yesterday-boundary check
 * (which would otherwise have nothing to resolve and incorrectly fail) — it simply resolves to
 * TODAY, exactly as an ordinary early arrival would.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>No-shift employees — there is no fallback, anywhere in this class</h2>
 * A brand-new employee with no Shift explicitly assigned (or one whose first
 * {@code EmployeeShiftAssignment} isn't effective yet) is a valid, permanent product state —
 * see {@code AttendanceInterpretationService}'s NO_SHIFT_ASSIGNED handling, which is the ONLY
 * place that state is ever handled: it checks
 * {@code EmployeeShiftAssignmentResolver#resolveIfPresent} BEFORE ever calling into this class,
 * and never routes a no-shift employee into any method here. Consequently every method on THIS
 * class still assumes an assigned Shift is already known to exist for the date in question — it
 * is never called speculatively for an employee that might not have one — and continues to throw
 * {@link IllegalStateException} for a null-shift employee rather than silently substituting any
 * fixed clock time (the previous {@code AttendanceProperties.shiftStart}/{@code shiftDayCutover}
 * -based fallbacks have both been removed entirely, from this class and from
 * {@code AttendanceProperties}). A null-shift employee reaching any method on THIS class directly
 * is therefore still exactly the anomaly it always was — the invariant moved one layer up (from
 * "every employee always has a Shift" to "every caller of ShiftDayPolicy already resolved one"),
 * it was not removed.
