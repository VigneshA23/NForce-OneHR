 * timing, applied one layer up to WHICH Shift an employee is even on. Nothing outside this class
 * (and {@code EmployeeAssignmentService}'s own CRUD, which creates/replaces assignment rows but
 * never resolves them for a business decision) should read an {@link EmployeeShiftAssignment}
 * directly for an attendance computation — always go through {@link #resolve}, keyed by the
 * specific date in question (typically {@code Attendance.workDate} or a fresh check-in's own
 * work-date), never by "the employee's current {@code Employee.shift}" — that field is a
 * best-effort display cache only, not authoritative (see {@code Employee.shift}'s own Javadoc).
