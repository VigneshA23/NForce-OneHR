/**
 * The logical-workday-reset algorithm, verified against every worked example from the design
 * discussion — see {@link ShiftDayPolicy}'s own Javadoc. Crossing the boundary is asserted to be
 * a pure query (no side effects) throughout; staleness/closure ownership is exercised separately
 * in AttendanceService's/WebClockInService's own tests.
 *
 * <p>Shift Versioning is faked here with a simple in-memory list per Shift ({@link
 * #withVersions}) rather than mocking {@link ShiftVersionResolver} per call — the resolver's own
 * "latest version with effectiveFrom <= day" semantics are exercised for real via a small stub
 * implementation, so a test that builds a shift with two versions actually proves the boundary
 * date resolves to the correct one, rather than merely asserting whatever a mock was told to say.
